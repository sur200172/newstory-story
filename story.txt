On a windy day, a boy roamed the streets of a city.The city had known 
laughter and joy just a few days ago. What had happened who knows?
all that stands is the mystic dust that flies around. The deadly dust that 
settles into the city's existence. The deadly silence is piercing and 
unbearable, and yet he tread on. A scrap of metal sways and then falls 
down in the junkyard. He looks up to his horse and then his fellow bard.
The nod in agreement that the city they had known was now just in ruins just
like thier souls.
