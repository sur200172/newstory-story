On a windy day, a boy roamed the streets of a city.The city had known 
laughter and joy just a few days ago. What had happened who knows?
All that stands is the mystic dust that flies around. The deadly dust that 
settles into the city's existence. The deadly silence is piercing and 
unbearable, and yet he treaded on. A scrap of metal sways and then falls 
down in the junkyard. He looks up to his horse and then his fellow bard.
They nod in agreement that the city they had known was now just in ruins just
like thier souls.

As they continued to wander the streets the only thing filling the void was 
the whistling of the wind in their ears. Eventually they came upon what used to
be the local deli. The rumbling of their stomachs could barely be heard under
the wind. They tied their horse, Jim-Bob, up to the ruins of a street sign and
went in to scavenge for food. Sifting through piles of debry, they were able to
find scraps of food that they promptly stuffed up under the scarves that 
covered their mouths. Once they had filled up for themselves and found some
food for Jim-Bob, they worked their way back through the wreckage to get 
outside. When they stepped back into the light of day, the wind seemed to be 
louder than before, and Jim-Bob was gone. His rope had be cut. They weren't as
alone as they thought.
